![AboutThePack](https://img.shields.io/badge/-About%20this%20pack-darkblue?style=for-the-badge)  
This pack adds subtle but *snappy* motion to otherwise static blocks — swinging signs, bouncing chests, and more!  
It’s that little bit of spice your builds didn’t know they needed. Even vanilla players will love it.
